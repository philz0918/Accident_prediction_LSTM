# Accident_prediction_LSTM

You can find the paper here, [Analysis of Fire Accident Factors on Construction Sites Using Web Crawling and Deep Learning Approach](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/21/11694).

1) Collect Newyork times news article about construction site accident
2) Compute frequency of accident by construction accident causes(fire, fell, struck, electrocution, caught in)
3) By months, generate prediction model with LSTM and BiLSTM
